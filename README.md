## Instructions:
To run the program, 
- run the command `g++ bezier1.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut`
- run `./a.out`

## Drawing a Curve:
Use the middle  mouse button to create a new point.  
Hold the left mouse button and drag to move the point around.  
Use the right mouse button near a control point to delete the point.  

A polyline joining all the control points will be created in green and the curve will be drawn in magenta.

### Libraries:
The following libraries will be needed to run the program:
- glm: GL math
- GL/glut
- GL/gl
- Others including vector, string, iostream
